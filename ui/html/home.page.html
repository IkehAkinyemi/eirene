      I'm Ikeh Akinyemi, but you can call me <b>Yemi</b>. I'm a Software
      Engineer with a fervor for open-source.

    <p>
      I possess a broad spectrum of technical expertise, with a keen focus on
      <b>distributed systems</b>, <b>OS (Linux)</b>,
      <b>database architecture</b>, and <b>network programming</b>. These
      specialized areas continually inspire me, enhancing my proficiency and
      deepening my understanding of backend development complexities.

      Beyond the realm of engineering, I'm a devoted student of mathematics. My
      academic pursuits have led me to explore the captivating worlds of both
      <em>Pure</em> and <em>Applied mathematics</em>, each offering unique
      perspectives and challenges.

      Outside the binaries and equations, I find solace in the pages of books.
      My reading list is a testament to my diverse interests, spanning software
      engineering, intricate mathematical theories, and the nuances of human
      psychology.
